          <p class="mb-3">
            Resla reserves the right to cancel a reservation at any time and at
            its sole discretion. Reasons for cancellation may include, but are
            not limited to, suspicious activity, fraud, forged insurance
            documents, invalid credit cards, reckless driving, or non-payment.
            Renters may cancel their reservation at any time by calling or
            texting Resla. Please refer to our Refund Policy below for further
            details.
          </p>

          <h3 class="mb-3 mt-5 fw-bold">REFUND POLICY</h3>

          <p class="mb-3">
            Renters may cancel their reservation without penalty up to 24 hours
            before the scheduled start of their trip. Cancellations made within
            24 hours of the trip start time may be eligible for a partial refund
            at Resla's discretion. If Resla cancels a reservation and the renter
            has not violated any policies or agreements, a refund will be issued
            for the unused portion of the trip. The cancellation time will be
            determined as the later of:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The time the vehicle is returned to the designated return
              location, or
            </li>
            <li>
              The time Resla is notified by call or text of the renter's intent
              to cancel the remaining portion of the trip and the vehicle is
              successfully returned to the designated return location.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="mb-3 mt-5 fw-bold">NO SHOW POLICY</h3>
          <p class="mb-5">
            A renter will be considered a no-show if they fail to cancel their
            reservation and do not arrive within 3 hours of the scheduled trip
            start time, or if the provided documentation is insufficient for
            verification purposes. Resla will not accommodate requests to delay
            the start time. Exceptions may be made at Resla's discretion for
            circumstances beyond the renter's control, such as delayed flights.
            Renters must notify Resla if they anticipate arriving later than 3
            hours after the scheduled start time.
