                            responsibility laws. The customer’s insurance will be primary. Any insurance
                            we are required to provide applies to claims of bodily injury and property

                            whether it is primary, secondary, excess, or contingent. Our policy contains

                            coverage. Customer agrees to cooperate with our insurer if any claim is
                            made. Our insurance applies only in the United States, and Canada. Customer
                            must obtain written permission, and purchase special liability insurance, to
                            use or operate the rental vehicle in Mexico. Where permitted by law,
                            customer rejects uninsured, underinsured, supplemental, personal injury
                            protection, and no‐fault coverage. Where we are required to provide such
                            coverage, renter is afforded the minimum limits required by law. Any breach
                            of this agreement will void any insurance Coverage.<br />Resla does not
                            extend any of its motor vehicle financial responsibility or provide public
